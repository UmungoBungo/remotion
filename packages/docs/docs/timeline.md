You can start preview your video using:

```bash
npm start
```

This is a shorthand for the [`studio`](/docs/cli/studio) command of the [Remotion CLI](/docs/cli):

```bash
npx remotion studio
```

A server will be started on port `3000` (or a higher port if it isn't available) and the Remotion Studio should open in the browser.

You can also use the left arrow or right arrow to do so. If you hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, you jump 1 second at a time.

## Toggling transparency mode

By default, the background of your video is a checkerboard pattern signifying that the pixels are transparent. You can press <svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" style={{width: 16, height: 16}}> <path d="M480 0H32A32 32 0 0 0 0 32v448a32 32 0 0 0 32 32h448a32 32 0 0 0 32-32V32a32 32 0 0 0-32-32zm-32 256H256v192H64V256h192V64h192z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg> button to disable this behavior which will render a black background.

## In / Out Markers

Use the <svg viewBox="0 0 256 256" fill="none" style={{width: 16, height: 16}}><path d="M158 25H99V230.5H158" stroke="currentcolor" strokeWidth="42" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round"/></svg> and <svg viewBox="0 0 256 256" fill="none" style={{width: 16, height: 16}}><path d="M98 25H157V230.5H98" stroke="currentcolor" strokeWidth="42" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round"/></svg> buttons to set an In or Out marker. When you play the video again, only the range within the markers will play.  
To clear a marker, make sure your playback head is at the point of a marker and press the button you pressed to activate it again.

You may also use the keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>I</kbd>: Set an in marker
- <kbd>O</kbd> (the letter "O"): Set an out marker
- <kbd>X</kbd>: Clear both markers.

## Change the canvas size

By default the video scales to fit in the preview window.  
You can:

- Pinch to zoom
- Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and use the scrollwheel or
- Use the dropdown that says `Fit`

to change the size of the canvas.

## Change the playback speed

By default the video will play with 1x speed. You can speed up or slow down the video by clicking on the dropdown that says `1x`.

You may also choose a negative value which will play the video in reverse. Note that [`<Audio/>`](/docs/audio) and [`<Video/>`](/docs/video) tags cannot be played in reverse, this is a browser limitation.

## Render a composition

Click on the `Render` button or press <kbd>R</kbd> to open the Render dialog from where you can adjust settings and render your composition.

If you are using `In / Out Markers`, the render dialog will automatically set the `Start Frame` and `End Frame` to your selected markers.

## Quick Switcher

Use <kbd>âŒ˜K</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> to access the Quick Switcher to quickly change compositions.  
Start your input with `>` to switch to the command palette.  
Start your input with `?` to search the documentation.

## Advanced playback controls

Use the <kbd>J</kbd>, <kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>L</kbd> keys to quickly move around the timeline while your video is playing.

<kbd>L</kbd> will play the video forward, pressing it repeatedly will play it faster.
<br />

<kbd>J</kbd> will play the video backwards, pressing it repeatedly will play it faster.
<br />

<kbd>K</kbd> will pause the video and reset the speed to 1x.
